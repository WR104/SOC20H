    <p>Madonna and the Performance of Identity

Along with Michael Jackson, Madonna (b. 1958) was one of the first stars
to truly understand and exploit the potential of music video and MTV.Even
more than Jackson, she relied less on conventional musical chops than

on creativevisual self-presentation,choreography,and dancing. Both

Michael Jackson's hits from his Thriller album and Madonna's early hits
proved that a significant audience existed for dance-oriented recordings.
In fact, Madonna's early recordings found success in dance clubs before
they were played on mainstream pop radio and before she ever made a
video. Her early videos projected a kind of ironic pastiche, playing offwellknown cinematic sequences; this occurred most strikingly in her video for
"Material Girl" (1985), in which Madonna presented herself as a Marilyn
Monroe—typecharacter in a scene based on the performance of the song
"Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend" (from Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, the
1954 film featuring Monroe).l Madonna's early image also made much of
her thrift-store attire, a look that had a lot in common with another female
star from this period who figured prominently on MTV: Cyndi Lauper.

Madonna subsequently proved herself adept at manipulating
her image and in maintaining media interest in her career—JonPareles memorablydescribed her as a "virtuoso of the superficial."2 Her

flaunting of her sexuality while presenting herself as being "in control"
(i.e., consciously choosing to flaunt her sexuality) provided a particularly potent model for young female fans (dubbed "wannabes") and
fueled debate about whether the Madonna persona represented a
new form of feminism or the repudiation of it. Because of her obvious

delight and skill in publicly manipulating this persona, Madonnahas
become a favorite of cultural critics. 3

The following essay by Camille Paglia presents a good overviewof
Madonna's career up through the early 1990s, with a particularly strong
focus on her videos. While Paglia's views on feminism provoked a storm
of controversy in the early 1990s, her enthusiasm for Madonna is related

to her ideas about the importance of instinctual sexuality, which, in

turn, formed part of her critique of feminism. Since Madonna's presentation of her sexuality constituted an undeniable part of her fascination,
Paglia's account illuminates Madonna's enormous impact in ways that a
more conventional, "distanced" academic account could not.

Venus of the Radio Waves
Camille Paglia
I'm a dyed-in-the-wool, true-blue Madonna fan.
It all started in 1984,when Madonna exploded onto MTVwith a brazen, insolent, in-your-face American street style, which she had taken from urban blacks,
Hispanics, and her own middle-class but turbulent and charismatic Italian American
family. From the start, there was a flamboyant and parodistic element to her sexuality, a hard glamour she had learned from Hollywood cinema and from its devotees,
gay men and drag queens.

Madonna is a dancer. She thinks and expresses herself through dance, which
exists in the eternal Dionysian realm of music. Dance, which she studied with a gay
man in her home state of Michigan, was her avenue of escape from the conventions
of religion and bourgeois society.The sensual language of her body allowed her to
transcend the over-verbalized codes of her class and time.
Madonna's great instinctive intelligence was evident to me from her earliest
videos. My first fights about her had to do with whether she was a good dancer or
merely a well-coached one. As year by year she built up the remarkable body of her
video work, with its dazzling number of dance styles, I have had to fight about that
less and less. However, I am still at war about her with feminists and religious conservatives (an illuminating alliance of contemporary puritans).
Most people who denigrate Madonna do so out of ignorance. The postwar babyboom generation in America, to which I belong, has been deeply immersed in popular culture for thirty-five years. Our minds were formed by rock music, which has

The 1980s

poured for twenty-four hours a day from hundreds of noisy, competitive independent radio stations around the country.
Madonna, like Venus stepping from the radio waves, emerged from this giant
river of music. Her artistic imagination ripples and eddies with the inner currentsin
American music. She is at her best when she follows her intuition and speaks to the
world in the universal language of music and dance. She is at her worst when she
tries to define and defend herself in words, which she borrows from louche, cynical
pals and shallow, single-issuepolitical activists.
Madonna consolidates and fuses several traditions of pop music, but the major

one she typifiesis disco, which emerged in the Seventiesand, under the bland

commercial rubric "dance music," is still going strong. It has a terrible reputation:
when you say the word disco,people think "Bee Gees." But I view disco, at its serious best, as a dark, grand Dionysian music with roots in African earth-cult.
Madonna's command of massive, resonant bass lines, which she heard in the
funky dance clubs of Detroit and New York,has always impressed me. As an Italian
Catholic,she uses them liturgically.Like me, she sensed the buried pagan religiosity
in disco. I recall my stunned admiration as I sat in the theater in 1987and first experienced the crashing, descendingchords of Madonna's "Causing a Commotion,"
which opened her dreadful movie Who'sThat Girl? If you want to hear the essence of
modernity, listen to those chords, infernal, apocalyptic, and grossly sensual. This is
the authentic voice of thefin de si&cle.
Madonna's first video, for her superb, drivingly lascivious disco hit "Bumin'
Up," did not make much of an impression. The platinum-blonde girl kneeling and

emoting in the middle of a midnight highway just seemed to be a band member's floozie. In retrospect, the video, with its rapid, cryptic surrealism,prefigures Madonna's
signature themes and contains moments of eerie erotic poetry.

"Lucky Star" was Madonna's breakthrough video. Against a luminous, white
abstract background, she and two impassive dancers perform a synchronized series
of jagged, modern kicks and steps. Wearing the ragtag outfit of all-black bows, see-

through netting, fingerless lace gloves, bangle bracelets, dangle earrings, chains, crucifixes,and punk booties that would set off a gigantic fashion craze among American

adolescent girls, Madonna flaunts her belly button and vamps the camera with a
smoky, piercing, come-hither-but-keep-your-distancestare. Here she first suggests
her striking talent for improvisationalfloor work, which she would spectacularly
demonstrate at the first MTVawards show, when, wrapped in a white-lace wedding
dress, she campily rolled and undulated snakelike on the stage, to the baffled con-

sternation of the first rows of spectators.
I remember sitting in a bar when "Lucky Star,"just out, appeared on TV.The
stranger perched next to me, a heavyset, middle-aged working-class woman, watched
the writhing Madonna and, wide-eyed and slightly frowning, blankly said, her beer
held motionless halfway to her lips, "Will you look at this?" There was a sense that
Madonna was doing something so new and so strange that one didn't know whether
to call it beautiful or grotesque, Through MTV,Madonna was transmitting an avantgarde downtown New York sensibility to the American masses,
In "Lucky Star," Madonna is raffish, gamine, still full of the street-urchin mischief that she would portray in her first and best film, Susan Seidelman's Desperately
SeekingSusan(1984).In "Borderline," she shows her burgeoning star quality.As the
girlfriend of Hispanic toughs who is picked up by a British photographer and makes
her first magazine cover, she presents the new dualities of her life: the gritty, multiracial street and club scene that she had haunted in obscurityand poverty, and her new
slick, fast world of popularity and success.

In one shot of "Borderline,"as she chummily chews gum with kidding girl-

friends on the corner, you can see the nondescript plainness of Madonna's real face,

Madonna and the Performance of Identity

which she again exposes, with admirable candor, in Truth or Dare when, slurping
soup and sporting a shower cap over hair rollers, she fences with her conservative
Italian father over the phone. Posing for the photographer in "Borderline," Madonna
in full cry fixes the camera lens with challenging, molten eyes, in a bold ritual display of sex and aggression. This early video impressed me with Madonna's sophisticated view of the fabrications of femininity, that exquisite theater which feminism

condemnsas oppressionbut which I see as a supreme artifact of civilization.I
sensed then, and now know for certain, that Madonna, like me, is drawn to drag

queens for their daring, flamboyant insight into sex roles, which they see far more
clearly and historically than do our endlessly complaining feminists.
Madonna's first major video, in artistic terms, was "Like a Virgin," where she
began to release her flood of inner sexual personae, which appear and disappear
like the painted creatures of masque. Madonna is an orchid-heavy Veronese duchess in white, a febrile Fassbinder courtesan in black, a slutty nun-turned-harlequin
flapping a gold cross and posturing, bum in air, like a demonic phantom in the nose
of a gondola. This video alone, with its coruscating polarities of evil and innocence,
would be enough to establish Madonna's artistic distinction for the next century.
In "Material Girl," where she sashays around in Marilyn Monroe's strapless red
gown and archly flashes her fan at a pack of men in tuxedos, Madonna first showed

her flair for comedy.Despite popular opinion, there are no important parallels
between Madonna and Monroe, who was a virtuoso comedienne but who was insecure, depressive, passive-aggressive,and infuriatingly obstructionistin her career
habits. Madonna is manic, perfectionist,workaholic.Monroe abused alcohol and
drugs, while Madonna shuns them. Monroe had a tentative, melting, dreamy solipsism; Madonna has Judy Holliday's wisecracking smart mouth and Joan Crawford's
steel will and bossy, circus-master managerial competence.
In 1985the cultural resistance to Madonna became overt. Despite the fact that
her "Into the Groove," the mesmerizing theme song of DesperatelySeekingSusan,had
saturated our lives for nearly a year, the Grammy Awards outrageously ignored her.

The feminist and moralist sniping began in earnest. Madonna "degraded" womanhood; she was vulgar, sacrilegious, stupid, shallow, opportunistic. A nasty mass
quarrel broke out in one of my classesbetween the dancers, who adored Madonna,
and the actresses, who scorned her.

I knew the quality of what I was seeing:"Open YourHeart," with its risqué
peep-show format, remains for me not only Madonna's greatest video but one of the

three or four best videos ever made. In the black bustier she made famous (transforming the American lingerie industry overnight), Madonna, bathed in blue-white
light, plays Marlene Dietrich straddling a chair. Her eyes are cold, distant, all-seeing.
She is ringed, as if in a sea-green aquarium, by windows of lewd or longing voyeurs:
sad sacks, brooding misfits, rowdy studs, dreamy gay twins, a melancholylesbian.

"Open Your Heart" is a brilliant mimed psychodrama of the interconnections
between art and pornography,love and lust. Madonnawon my undying loyalty
by reviving and re-creatingthe hard glamour of the studio-eraHollywood movie
queens, figures of mythological grandeur. Contemporary feminism cut itself off from

history and bankrupted itself when it spun its puerile, paranoid fantasy of male
oppressors and female sex-objectvictims. Woman is the dominant sex. Woman's
sexual glamour has bewitched and destroyed men since Delilah and Helen of Troy.
Madonna, role model to millions of girls worldwide, has cured the ills of feminism
by reassertingwoman's command of the sexual realm
Responding to the spiritual tensions within Italian Catholicism,Madonna
discoveredthe buried paganism within the church. The torture of Christ and the
martyrdom of the saints, represented in lurid polychrome images, dramatize the
passions of the body, repressed in art-fearing puritan Protestantism of the kind that

376

The 1980s

still lingers in America. Playing with the outlaw personae of prostitute and dominatrix, Madonna has made a major contributionto the history of women. She has
rejoined and healed the split halves of woman: Mary, the BlessedVirgin and holy
mother, and Mary Magdalene, the harlot.

Madonna's inner emotionallife can be heard in the smooth, transparent "La Isla

Bonita," one of her most perfect songs, with its haunting memory of paradise lost.
No one ever mentions it. Publicity has tended to focus instead on the more blatantly
message-heavy videos, like "Papa Don't Preach," with its teen pregnancy, or "Express

Yourself," where feminist cheerleading lyrics hammer on over crisp, glossy images of
bedroom bondage, dungeon torture, and epicene, crotch-grabbing Weimar elegance.

"Like a Prayer" gave Pepsi-Coladyspepsia: Madonna receives the stigmata,

makes love with the animated statue of a black saint, and dances in a rumpled silk
slip in front of a field of burning crosses. This last item, with its uncontrolled racial
allusions, shocked even me. But Madonna has a strange ability to remake symbolism in her own image. Kitsch and trash are transformed by her high-energy dancer's
touch, her earnest yet over-the-top drag-queen satire.
Madonna has evolved physically. In a charming early live video, "Dress You Up," she
is warm, plump, and flirty under pink and powder-blue light. Her voice is enthusiastic but thin and breathy. She began to train both voice and body, so that her present silhouette, with some erotic loss, is wiry and muscular, hyperkinetic for acrobatic dance
routines based on the martial arts. Madonna is notorious for monthly or even weekly
changes of hair color and style, by which she embodies the restless individualism of
Western personality. Children love her. As with the Beatles, this is always the sign of
a monumental pop phenomenon.
Madonna has her weak moments: for example, I have no tolerance for the giggling

baby talk that she periodically hauls out of the closet, as over the final credits of Truthor
Dare. She is a complex modern woman. Indeed, that is the main theme of her extraordinary achievement. She is exploring the problems and tensions of being an ambitious

woman today. Like the potent Barbra Streisand, whose maverick female style had a
great impact on American girls in the Sixties,Madonna is confronting the romantic
dilemma of the strong woman looking for a man but uncertain whether she wants a
tyrant or slave. The tigress in heat is drawn to surrender but may kill her conqueror.
In "Open Your Heart," Madonna is woman superbly alone, master of her own
fate. Offstage at the end, she mutates into an androgynous boy-self and runs off. "What
a Tramp!" thundered the New YorkPost in a recent full-page headline. Yes, Madonna
has restored the Whore of Babylon, the pagan goddess banned by the last book of the
Bible. With an instinct for world-domination gained from Italian Catholicism, she
has rolled like a juggernaut over the multitude of her carping critics. This is a kaleidoscopic career still in progress. But Madonna's most enduring cultural contribution

may be that she has introduced ravishing visual beauty and a lush Mediterranean
sensuality into parched, pinched, word-drunk Anglo-Saxonfeminism.
