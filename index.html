    <p>Along with Michael Jackson, Madonna (b. 1958) was one of the first stars to truly understand and exploit the potential of music video and MTV. Even more than Jackson, she relied less on conventional musical chops than on creative visual self-presentation, choreography, and dancing. BothMichael Jackson's hits from his Thriller album and Madonna's early hits proved that a significant audience existed for dance-oriented recordings. In fact, Madonna's early recordings found success in dance clubs before they were played on mainstream pop radio and before she ever made a video. Her early videos projected a kind of ironic pastiche, playing offwell- known cinematic sequences; this occurred most strikingly in her video for "Material Girl" (1985), in which Madonna presented herself as a Marilyn Monroe—type character in a scene based on the performance of the song "Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend" (from Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, the 1954 film featuring Monroe). l Madonna's early image also made much of her thrift-store attire, a look that had a lot in common with another female star from this period who figured prominently on MTV: Cyndi Lauper.

Because of her obvious poured for twenty-four hours a day from hundreds of noisy, competitive independ-ent radio stations around the country.Madonna, like Venus stepping from the radio waves, emerged from this giantriver of music. Her artistic imagination ripples and eddies with the inner currents inAmerican music. She is at her best when she follows her intuition and speaks to theworld in the universal language of music and dance. She is at her worst when shetries to define and defend herself in words, which she borrows from louche, cynicalpals and shallow, single-issue political activists.Madonna consolidates and fuses several traditions of pop music, but the majorone she typifies is disco, which emerged in the Seventies and, under the blandcommercial rubric "dance music," is still going strong. It has a terrible reputation:when you say the word disco, people think "Bee Gees." But I view disco, at its seri-ous best, as a dark, grand Dionysian music with roots in African earth-cult.Madonna's command of massive, resonant bass lines, which she heard in thefunky dance clubs of Detroit and New York, has always impressed me. As an ItalianCatholic, she uses them liturgically. Like me, she sensed the buried pagan religiosityin disco. I recall my stunned admiration as I sat in the theater in 1987 and first expe-rienced the crashing, descending chords of Madonna's "Causing a Commotion,"which opened her dreadful movie Who's That Girl? If you want to hear the essence ofmodernity, listen to those chords, infernal, apocalyptic, and grossly sensual. This isthe authentic voice of thefin de si&cle.Madonna's first video, for her superb, drivingly lascivious disco hit "Bumin'Up," did not make much of an impression. The platinum-blonde girl kneeling andemoting in the middle of a midnight highway just seemed to be a band member's floo-zie. In retrospect, the video, with its rapid, cryptic surrealism, prefigures Madonna'ssignature themes and contains moments of eerie erotic poetry."Lucky Star" was Madonna's breakthrough video. Against a luminous, whiteabstract background, she and two impassive dancers perform a synchronized seriesof jagged, modern kicks and steps. Wearing the ragtag outfit of all-black bows, see-through netting, fingerless lace gloves, bangle bracelets, dangle earrings, chains, cru-cifixes, and punk booties that would set off a gigantic fashion craze among Americanadolescent girls, Madonna flaunts her belly button and vamps the camera with asmoky, piercing, come-hither-but-keep-your-distance stare. Here she first suggestsher striking talent for improvisational floor work, which she would spectacularlydemonstrate at the first MTV awards show, when, wrapped in a white-lace weddingdress, she campily rolled and undulated snakelike on the stage, to the baffled con-sternation of the first rows of spectators.I remember sitting in a bar when "Lucky Star," just out, appeared on TV. Thestranger perched next to me, a heavyset, middle-aged working-class woman, watchedthe writhing Madonna and, wide-eyed and slightly frowning, blankly said, her beerheld motionless halfway to her lips, "Will you look at this?" There was a sense thatMadonna was doing something so new and so strange that one didn't know whetherto call it beautiful or grotesque, Through MTV, Madonna was transmitting an avant-garde downtown New York sensibility to the American masses,In "Lucky Star," Madonna is raffish, gamine, still full of the street-urchin mis-chief that she would portray in her first and best film, Susan Seidelman's DesperatelySeeking Susan (1984). In "Borderline," she shows her burgeoning star quality. As thegirlfriend of Hispanic toughs who is picked up by a British photographer and makesher first magazine cover, she presents the new dualities of her life: the gritty, multira-cial street and club scene that she had haunted in obscurity and poverty, and her newslick, fast world of popularity and success.In one shot of "Borderline," as she chummily chews gum with kidding girl-friends on the corner, you can see the nondescript plainness of Madonna's real face,which she again exposes, with admirable candor, in Truth or Dare when, slurping soup and sporting a shower cap over hair rollers, she fences with her conservative Italian father over the phone. Posing for the photographer in "Borderline," Madonna in full cry fixes the camera lens with challenging, molten eyes, in a bold ritual dis- play of sex and aggression. This early video impressed me with Madonna's sophis- ticated view of the fabrications of femininity, that exquisite theater which feminism condemns as oppression but which I see as a supreme artifact of civilization. I sensed then, and now know for certain, that Madonna, like me, is drawn to drag queens for their daring, flamboyant insight into sex roles, which they see far more clearly and historically than do our endlessly complaining feminists. Madonna's first major video, in artistic terms, was "Like a Virgin," where she began to release her flood of inner sexual personae, which appear and disappear like the painted creatures of masque. Madonna is an orchid-heavy Veronese duch- ess in white, a febrile Fassbinder courtesan in black, a slutty nun-turned-harlequin flapping a gold cross and posturing, bum in air, like a demonic phantom in the nose of a gondola. This video alone, with its coruscating polarities of evil and innocence, would be enough to establish Madonna's artistic distinction for the next century. In "Material Girl," where she sashays around in Marilyn Monroe's strapless red gown and archly flashes her fan at a pack of men in tuxedos, Madonna first showed her flair for comedy. Despite popular opinion, there are no important parallelsbetween Madonna and Monroe, who was a virtuoso comedienne but who was inse- cure, depressive, passive-aggressive, and infuriatingly obstructionist in her career habits. Madonna is manic, perfectionist, workaholic. Monroe abused alcohol and drugs, while Madonna shuns them. Monroe had a tentative, melting, dreamy solip- sism; Madonna has Judy Holliday's wisecracking smart mouth and Joan Crawford's steel will and bossy, circus-master managerial competence. In 1985 the cultural resistance to Madonna became overt. Despite the fact that her "Into the Groove," the mesmerizing theme song of Desperately Seeking Susan, had saturated our lives for nearly a year, the Grammy Awards outrageously ignored her. The feminist and moralist sniping began in earnest. Madonna "degraded" wom- anhood; she was vulgar, sacrilegious, stupid, shallow, opportunistic. A nasty mass quarrel broke out in one of my classes between the dancers, who adored Madonna, and the actresses, who scorned her. I knew the quality of what I was seeing: "Open Your Heart," with its risqué peep-show format, remains for me not only Madonna's greatest video but one of the three or four best videos ever made. In the black bustier she made famous (trans- forming the American lingerie industry overnight), Madonna, bathed in blue-white light, plays Marlene Dietrich straddling a chair. Her eyes are cold, distant, all-seeing. She is ringed, as if in a sea-green aquarium, by windows of lewd or longing voyeurs: sad sacks, brooding misfits, rowdy studs, dreamy gay twins, a melancholy lesbian. "Open Your Heart" is a brilliant mimed psychodrama of the interconnections between art and pornography, love and lust. Madonna won my undying loyalty by reviving and re-creating the hard glamour of the studio-era Hollywood movie queens, figures of mythological grandeur. Contemporary feminism cut itself off from history and bankrupted itself when it spun its puerile, paranoid fantasy of male oppressors and female sex-object victims. Woman is the dominant sex. Woman's sexual glamour has bewitched and destroyed men since Delilah and Helen of Troy. Madonna, role model to millions of girls worldwide, has cured the ills of feminism by reasserting woman's command of the sexual realm Responding to the spiritual tensions within Italian Catholicism, Madonna discovered the buried paganism within the church. The torture of Christ and the martyrdom of the saints, represented in lurid polychrome images, dramatize the passions of the body, repressed in art-fearing puritan Protestantism of the kind thatstill lingers in America. Playing with the outlaw personae of prostitute and domi-natrix, Madonna has made a major contribution to the history of women. She hasrejoined and healed the split halves of woman: Mary, the Blessed Virgin and holymother, and Mary Magdalene, the harlot. Madonna's inner emotional life can be heard in the smooth, transparent "La IslaBonita," one of her most perfect songs, with its haunting memory of paradise lost.No one ever mentions it. Publicity has tended to focus instead on the more blatantlymessage-heavy videos, like "Papa Don't Preach," with its teen pregnancy, or "ExpressYourself," where feminist cheerleading lyrics hammer on over crisp, glossy images ofbedroom bondage, dungeon torture, and epicene, crotch-grabbing Weimar elegance."Like a Prayer" gave Pepsi-Cola dyspepsia: Madonna receives the stigmata,makes love with the animated statue of a black saint, and dances in a rumpled silkslip in front of a field of burning crosses. This last item, with its uncontrolled racialallusions, shocked even me. But Madonna has a strange ability to remake symbol-ism in her own image. Kitsch and trash are transformed by her high-energy dancer'stouch, her earnest yet over-the-top drag-queen satire. Madonna has evolved physically. In a charming early live video, "Dress You Up," sheis warm, plump, and flirty under pink and powder-blue light. Her voice is enthusias-tic but thin and breathy. She began to train both voice and body, so that her present sil-houette, with some erotic loss, is wiry and muscular, hyperkinetic for acrobatic danceroutines based on the martial arts. Madonna is notorious for monthly or even weeklychanges of hair color and style, by which she embodies the restless individualism ofWestern personality. Children love her. As with the Beatles, this is always the sign ofa monumental pop phenomenon.Madonna has her weak moments: for example, I have no tolerance for the gigglingbaby talk that she periodically hauls out of the closet, as over the final credits of Truth orDare. She is a complex modern woman. Indeed, that is the main theme of her extraor-dinary achievement. She is exploring the problems and tensions of being an ambitiouswoman today. Like the potent Barbra Streisand, whose maverick female style had agreat impact on American girls in the Sixties, Madonna is confronting the romanticdilemma of the strong woman looking for a man but uncertain whether she wants atyrant or slave. The tigress in heat is drawn to surrender but may kill her conqueror.In "Open Your Heart," Madonna is woman superbly alone, master of her ownfate. Offstage at the end, she mutates into an androgynous boy-self and runs off. "Whata Tramp!" thundered the New York Post in a recent full-page headline. Yes, Madonnahas restored the Whore of Babylon, the pagan goddess banned by the last book of theBible. With an instinct for world-domination gained from Italian Catholicism, shehas rolled like a juggernaut over the multitude of her carping critics. This is a kalei-doscopic career still in progress. But Madonna's most enduring cultural contributionmay be that she has introduced ravishing visual beauty and a lush Mediterraneansensuality into parched, pinched, word-drunk Anglo-Saxon feminism</p>
